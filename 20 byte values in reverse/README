Lab_16:
Write 20 byte values to a file called lab16.dat.
Read the values back from the file and output to the screen in reverse order.

DataOutputStreamDemo:
If you keep reading data from a file, you will eventually hit the end. This will produce a EOFException.
Write a program that catches the EOF error and handles it gracefully.
